This includes dealing with RNG elements associated with Stitchcraft-related quests.\n\n### Important Covenant Sanctum Upgrades:\n- **Abominable Stitching - Rank 5**\n- **Anima Conductor - Rank 1** (Needed for additional achievements like [achievement=14753])\n- **Scouting Table - Rank 1** (Recommended for acquiring [item=183744], which is significantly beneficial)\n\n### Community Tips:\n- Using a WeakAura to notify when superior parts are available on the mission table can save time and effort.\n- Completing this achievement on an alt character does count toward the **Shadowlands Dilettante** meta-achievement across multiple characters.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPrepare for a substantial commitment to complete this achievement. Despite bugs and the grind involved, success brings notable rewards and a prestigious title.
